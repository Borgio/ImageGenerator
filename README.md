# Compiling

To compile the image generator, you need

* Visual Studio 2013 or above
* The Intel C++ compiler version 15+
* The Boost libraries
* The Intel Math Kernel Library

The project is entirely 64-bit so the different libs should also be compiled to 64-bit.

Some paths are, by necessity, hardcoded into the project settings and need to be adjusted.
